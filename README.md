# Group-Chat-Application
This is a simple group chat application to demonstrate the idea of the one you see in WhatsApp messenger with the localhost server. Multiple users can come and share their views here. The MySQL database stores the chats and retrieves it effectively. To implement this application successfully, we have to build the CSS and JavaScript for styling the UI, HTML part to render it, PHP code for storing and retrieving from the database. This application will contain two fields namely the username and the text message. The messages of the user who texts first will be aligned to the right side of the chatroom and messages of the others at the left side. Let us look at the implementation.
